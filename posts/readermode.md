## A short rant about reader-mode

*It's a complaint about certain web browsers anyways...*

So I make my blog, make it all weird and sci-fi looking. It went really well. I went ahead and tested it on Safari, and Safari on mobile. Noticed reader-mode works quite nicely. So I release the blog. One of the first comments I got was from Tippi, explaining new HTML tags such as `<article>` and `<nav>`, they're intended to make pages more accessible. I ultimately decided to use them, but never really got around to it.

Fast forward to when I felt more motivated to make the change. I was on Firefox, and noticed reader-view wasn't an option. I did some searching and determined it works off of arcane magic that nobody really understands. However people seem to insist if I have the accessibility tags like `<article>` specifically, it should work like a charm! Seemed like a fair thing to me (despite it just working out of the box on Safari), so I slapped in both `<article>` and `<nav>`.

Well this actually changed nothing at all. Despite Firefox being able to detect where the article is (I checked), for whatever reason, the reader mode (without error) will not detect the article.

So there you have it, if your browser doesn't support reader mode on my pages, ask the dev team for your favourite browser. I've done my part to make my page accessible, have they done their's?

<span hidden>I dream of a world where these janky hunks of lead go to the wayside and we get something new ... If web browsers can't even render an article properly, what are they even for? Think about it, what advantage is this "all encompassing" tool you're using to read this article giving you? Browsers are slowing down the advancement of technology because people over-rely on them, and quite frankly I'm getting tired of it. If I was asked what a browser should be for I'd say "reading/rendering documents on the world wide web". Today we use them for quite literally everything, gimping ourselves in the pursuit of better technologies, and for what?</span>
